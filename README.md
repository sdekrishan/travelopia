 ## Api Documentation

 There are only one Route on which we have completed two tasks.
 - /booking -> if you do POST request on this route you can post the data to the database. you have to pass name, email, budget, destination and totalTravellers as json to body only then you can post the data. If you post the data then you got **booking Successful** as message other wise you got the error.
